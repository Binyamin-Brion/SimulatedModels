Note: Every simulation has a picture showing the code that was changed compared to the default code.

Observations:

Initial Position:

Changing the initial position of the infected cell changes the location of the start and end of the infections. The rate of people who become
infected and recover remains the same, assuming all other parameters of the simulation are the same.

SIR:

Changing Population to Overwhemingly Susceptible: The number of infected is so low that the infections die out.

Changing Population to Overwhemingly Infection: The number of infected is initially really high, but afterwards 
goes on the decline until no mroe are infected, as there are not enough susceptible people to newly infect.

Changing Population to Overwhemingly Recovered: The epidemic is done, as there are no new people to infect and
everyone is now immune to the new infections.

MC:

Lowering either the movement or connection factor results in the infection spreading less rapdily and potentially limiting its as well. 
Lowering either one of these factors produces the same result, since as mentioned in the Hoya paper, these factors are correlated with each other.

VR:

If the virulency drops below that of recovery, then no infections happen.
Assuming virulency stays above that of recovery:

- If the recovery rate drops, the epidemic is spread over a longer period of time
- If the recovery rate is increased, the epidemic finishes sooner

Zong:

- Changing the recovery rate results in faster increase in a the recovered population, resulting in a more flatter, more constant
population of infected. The number of new recovered persons closely matches the number of infected people.

- Increasing the number of infected leads to less people being suscpetible more quickly as time goes on

- Increasing the moblity rates results in the epidemic passing sooner
